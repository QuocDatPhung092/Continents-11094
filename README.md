# Continents-11094
My Java solution for competitve programming Online Judge's Problem 11094 "Continents". Finished in 2 days. 

Please note that the Online Judge only accepts code in one Java file. So I put all my code into Main.java. In reality, I put each class into individually seperated files.

This programming assignment was giving to us students in the CSI 2110 course (Data Structures and Algorithms). We used Breadth First Search to find the largest continent in a given map dataset. The solution must be O(n). My solution passed and received an A+ for this part.
